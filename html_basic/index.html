  <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>
  <p>This is my very first webpage built with HTML. It feels amazing to start learning web development step by step.</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am learning how to code and build cool projects from scratch. Every line of code brings me closer to my goals.</p>

  <h3>My Journey</h3>
  <p>Practice makes progress. By building pages like this, Iâ€™m sharpening my skills and having fun at the same time.</p>
